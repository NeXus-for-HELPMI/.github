# NeXus for HELPMI

HELPMI (HElmholtz Laser-Plasma Metadata Initiative) is a 2 year project of GSI, HI-Jena and HZDR, funded by the Helmholtz Metadata Collaboration, which addresses the problem that no data standard exists for ultra-high intensity laser plasma experiments, hampering the FAIR principles and associated emerging benefits.

Therefore, our goal is to
* Adopt [NeXus](https://www.nexusformat.org/) base classes for LPA experimental data, starting from the example above, aiming for a definition
* Extend [openPMD](https://www.openpmd.org/#/start) for arbitrary hierarchies like NeXus, making the standards interoperable
* Develop a glossary for LPA experiment data and infer the ontology, for automated validation and processing
   * [Draft version (May 2024):](https://github.com/NeXus-for-HELPMI/Devices-Detectors-Components-Library)

Here is the playground for adapting NeXus for our needs.
